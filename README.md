## Building source code

- First, we need to clone the Websocket++ library repository to this top repo
```
git clone https://github.com/trungqudinh/file-storage.git
cd file-storage
git clone https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp.git
```

- Because of this based on Websocket++ library, so we need some other libraries to build source code
```
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libjsoncpp-dev -y
``` 


- Then run with make command.
```
make client # to build client
make server # to build server
make all    # to build both
```

- The binary file can be found in `/build` directory after built.
```
build/
├── client
└── server
```

## Run the app

### Server

- Create the *data/* directory with same level of the binary file. To run the server we use:

  > ./build/server <PORT> <FILE_STORING_PATH> <DATABASE_FILE_NAME>
 
Example:
```
./build/server 9002 data/ database.db
```

Default value of abave parameter is:
```
              PORT: 9002
 FILE_STORING_PATH: data/
DATABASE_FILE_NAME: database.db
```

**NOTE**: `FILE_STORING_PATH` need to have a trailing "/" charater.

### Client

Use the command to run the client code:
  > ./build/client URI [OPTIONS] [FILES_TO_SEND]
  
```
OPTIONS:
    --files:        return the file infomation that user_id has sent before.
                    The contain of file is JSON array with this format:
                    {
                        files : [
                            [
                                file_name,
                                file_size,
                                file_check_sum,
                            ],
                            ...
                        ]
                    }
    FILES_TO_SEND   The list of files, or single file to send to server.
```
Example:
```
./build/client wss://localhost:9002/client/ws?content-type=audio/x-raw,user_id=123456789 --files
./build/client wss://localhost:9002/client/ws?content-type=audio/x-raw,user_id=testuser1 --files test/test_data1.txt
./build/client wss://localhost:9002/client/ws?content-type=audio/x-raw,user_id=account01 --files test/test_data1.txt /usr/bin/ls
```

Example output of `--files` option:

    {
        "files" : [
            [
                "tree",
                "85608",
                "75a256ed8adae3bdf57e433f97971ed6cdf7cabe5a3d0de9bfd44b3658b2fa5c"
            ],
            [
                "output.dat",
                "25165824",
                "95aeaae03b56c171cf88753c821630a3c24f1fcf406cec3e17d56781aa3f8369"
            ]
        ]
    }


## How does they work?

### On client side

Every time run command, client can send data file to server and store there.
If the data to large it will be split by smaller chunks. Each chunk will have
max size is 10 * 1024 * 1024 bytes. And they're hard code currently.

```
  +---------+  +--------+         +---------+  +--------+
  |         |  |        |         |         |  |        |
  | Chunk 1 |  |Chunk 2 |   ...   | Chunk   |  |Chunk n |
  |         |  |        |         |   n-1   |  | x bytes|
  +---------+  +--------+         +---------+  +--------+
```

### On server side

Server will received chunk from clients, then merge them on server side. Files are stored with the name is is checksum value.
For that, we can prevent to received same file.
The database are a normal text file that store:

- user_id: Id of user
- file_checksum: Checksum value of file.
- request_id
- received_time
- file_name: If different user_id sent same file with different name. They stil be saved. But there's only one file are save.
- file_size

```

### Inside a chunk

Each chunk file will contain some following value:

- curr_checksum: The current checksum of current sending chunk.
- prev_checksum: With the chunk n, this is checksum value of chunk n-1
- file_name
- file_checksum: The checksum of full file. Based on the, server know when the file are finished.
- data: The bytes data of the chunk.

With each received chunk, server will send back the `prev_checksum` to client to notify that server's ready to receive the next one.
